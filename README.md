# Jack's dotfiles
This is where I keep all my dotfiles.

## Home

Linux dotfiles. Managed with gnu stow, organized by purpose. To use:

```
cd Home
stow -t ~ {folder}
```

Folders of note here are:

- shell
- bin
- vim
- git
- i3
- term

## Win

Windows configs. Most of the juicy stuff is AutoHotKey related, and is managed by `startup.ahk`

Also contains registry tweaks, various configs, and some (mostly unused) Appdata stuff.

## Install

Contains some scripts for initially setting up a new system. Nothing too fancy here.
